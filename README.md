This is the R code used for my graduation thesis for the BSc. Actuarial Science at University of Amsterdam.
Notification: This code uses enourmous computational resources by parallel process and also computationally expensive. If you just need the result for other variables I did not mention in the thesis, you can import the .Rwork file.

The URL for the thesis is
